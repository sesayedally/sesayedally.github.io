**Project Description:** This app provides autocomplete functionality from within a textbox.
You can type in a Pokemon name and it will bring up names as you are typing.

All data is stored in a local array. Autocomplete is case sensitive as well.
Ideally I would like to fetch data from an API and display it as well at a later stage.
